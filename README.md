SQL Project: Customers–Orders–Books Management System
1️⃣ Project Overview

This project simulates a bookstore system where customers purchase books. The goal is to analyze sales, customer behavior, book performance, and author contributions using SQL.

It includes 3 main tables:

Customers → Stores customer details.

Books → Stores information about books.

Orders → Stores order transactions (who bought what, when, and how much)
